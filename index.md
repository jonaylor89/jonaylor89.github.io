As of now, I am a software engineer tinkering with website design :P

I program a lot of different things in a lot of different langauges. There's no
real reason for this except for me getting bored all the time. I'll be a web
developer one week, making logos in inkscape, then a OS dev the next, debugging
things with gdb. It really just depends on my mood.
